  There are many people contributing to Macaulay2 development, and we welcome help!
  This directory contains descriptions of projects that need doing, together with
  an indication of whether anyone is working on them currently.

<p>
  If a project sounds interesting, before embarking on it, talk to us and we'll
  register your intentions here.  Be careful also to check the <b>Project
  assigned to</b> and <b>Current status</b> fields in the project description;
  unassigned or quiescent projects could easily become yours.
