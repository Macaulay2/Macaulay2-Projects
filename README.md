Macaulay2 Projects
==================

  There are many people contributing to Macaulay2 development, and we welcome help!
  This directory contains descriptions of projects that need doing, together with
  an indication of whether anyone is working on them currently. 

  If a project sounds interesting, before embarking on it talk to us and we'll
  register your interest and plans here.  Check the *Project assigned to* and
  *Current status* fields in the project description, to see whether the
  project is unassigned or quiescent.

  If you have a new project to propose, advertise it on the [Macaulay2 google
  group](http://groups.google.com/group/macaulay2) to find out if anyone else
  is thinking about it.  We may then ask you to write it up using the file
  "TEMPLATE", including appropriate references to the mathematical literature,
  so we can add it to the list here.
