Title: convex hulls

Description:  

Write a new package, to be called ConvexHulls, that uses the package
FourierMotzkin to implement general purpose routines for computing with convex
polytopes.

The package should not simply duplicate the functionality of "polymake", but
instead should explore the links between polyhedral geometry and algebra,
playing to the existing strengths of Macaulay 2.  For example, many aspects of
Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky's or Sturmfels' work would naturally fit in this
context.

The package could include functions that:

   - compute the convex hull of a set of points in R^n, returning
     a polytope.  Maybe that should be a new type of object
     (behind the scenes the points span rays in R^(n+1) but we keep
      that always hidden (hidden how?, that could be an interesting design
      decision))

   - provide the vertices of a polytope.  Maybe that should be a new
     type of object.

   - provide the degree of a vertex

   - provide the bounding hyperplanes of a convex polytope.

   - provide the facets of a polytope as polytopes.  For 2-dimensional faces,
     alternatively provide the facets as polygons, i.e., as correctly ordered
     cyclic lists of vertices, suitable for input into a graphics program

   - provide interfaces to 5 or so graphics programs that could be used
     to display polytopes

   - provide the incidence relation between the vertices and the facets

   - for any k, provide the complete list of faces of codimension k

   - given a point and a polytope, determine the smallest facecontaining
     the point, if any

   - compute the Newton polytope of a polynomial in several variables
     (a one liner that starts with "exponents f" where f is the polynomial)
