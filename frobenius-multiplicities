Title: Frobenius Multiplicities

Description: For rings of characteristic p > 0, the Frobenius morphism x |-> x^p provides an
honest ring endomorphism with surprising utility.  One application is the study
of Hilbert-Kunz and related multiplicities.  

Implement the Frobenius and its action on complexes of free modules as a way to 
quickly compute approximations of Hilbert-Kunz and higher derived multiplicities of a ring.

Proposed by: Jason McCullough
Potential Advisor: Dan Grayson
Project assigned to: Jason McCullough
Current status: A working project file is completed.  It needs documentation and
   error checking.  Extensions to computing Hilbert-Kunz multiplicities of m-primary
   ideals are possible.  

   As of now the ring in question much be a quotient of a polynomial ring by a 
   homogeneous ideal.
