Title: Generic Initial Ideals

Description: 

See Eisenbud's book on Commutative Algebra for the definition, and for
many of the very useful properties of generic initial ideals.

See also:

This is a good "getting started" project.  One way to
probabilisitically compute the generic initial ideal of an ideal (with
respect to a term order) is to make a random change of coordinates,
and take the lead term ideal of the resulting ideal.

This is only probabilistic: it could give the wrong answer.  One way
around this is to do the above several times, and take a consensus.
The choice of how many times to do it should probably be an optional
argument.

An interesting research project would be to find a method to certify
that one has found the generic initial ideal.  One way is to add n^2
variables (if the original polynomial ring has n variables), and to 
make the "generic" change of coordinates.  Unfortunately, this is often
computationally prohibitive.

There is a rough template for this package already, at:
M2/Macaulay2/packages/GenericInitialIdeals.m2,
but it has not been written yet.

Many people would like to see this in M2!
