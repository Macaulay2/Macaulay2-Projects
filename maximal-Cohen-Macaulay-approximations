Title: Maximal Cohen-Macaulay Approximations

Description: Given a Gorenstein ring A and finitely generated A-module
M, Auslander-Buchweitz show that there is a short exact sequence 
0 -> M -> Q -> L -> 0 such that Q has finite projective dimension and L 
is maximal Cohen-Macaulay.

Using a couple results of Dutta, the modules Q and L and the map M ->
Q may be explicitly computed using graded duality and a mapping cone
construction.

See:

"On Negativity of Higher Euler Characteristics" by S.P. Dutta,
American Journal of Mathematics, 126 (2004), 1341-1354.

Proposed by: Jason McCullough 
Potential Advisor: Dan Grayson 
Project assigned to: Jason McCullough 
Current status: Some working code for the Gorenstein case is done.  It needs 
to be cleaned up and put into a package.  

The corresponding exact sequence of Auslander-Bridger could also be
computed and returned.

Are there algorithms for doing this outside of the
Gorenstein case?
