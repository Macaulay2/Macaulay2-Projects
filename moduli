Title: Intersection theory on moduli spaces of curves

Description:

An M2 package for some intersection theory on Mbar(g,n), the Deligne-Mumford
compactification of the moduli spaces of n-pointed genus g curves. This
probably would/should be based on the old Maple Worksheets (Maple 8 and 7 if I
remember correctly; they definitely don't run anymore with the current version
of Maple) by Carel Faber computing intersection numbers of the various kappa,
lambda and psi classes. Carel used them initially to test his conjectures, but
the worksheets have also been used by number of other people (while they
work(ed) with Maple...)

The ideas behind the Maple worksheets are explained in Carel's paper:
"Algorithms for  computing intersection numbers on moduli  spaces of
curves ..."  I've attached to this email a tar.gz file with all of 
Carel's  Maple files and his paper (the version that I had).

Progress log:

February 2009: Stephanie Yang and Greg Smith have written some code in Macaulay
2 working in this direction.

Jameel Al-Aidrous has written a lot of code for the tautological subring of
M_(g,n) in python (Berkeley PhD thesis, student of Graber and Eisenbud.)
