Title: Noether Normalization

Description:

Implement Noether normalization for quotients of polynomial rings over
fields.  This is another good "getting started" project, and one which
would be useful to many people.

The result might be a ring map from a polynomial ring, but Dan should
be consulted about a good interface.  Issues to think about: (1) doing
this with a change of variables which is as sparse as possible, (2)
What about characteristic p > 0, in small characteristic?

There is code in Singular for this too, which might be worth consulting.

It might be good to incorporate Hashemi's explicit examples of ideals into a
package.

We might need two routines, "noetherPosition" and "noetherNormalization".
