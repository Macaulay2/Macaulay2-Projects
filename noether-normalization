Title: Noether Normalization

Description:

Implement Noether normalization for quotients of polynomial rings over
fields.  This is another good "getting started" project, and one which
would be useful to many people.

The result might be a ring map from a polynomial ring, but Dan should
be consulted about a good interface.  Issues to think about: (1) doing
this with a change of variables which is as sparse as possible, (2)
What about characteristic p > 0, in small characteristic?

There is code in Singular for this too, which might be worth consulting.

It might be good to incorporate Hashemi's explicit examples of ideals into a
package.

We might need two routines, "noetherPosition" and "noetherNormalization".

Mike says: see the papers of Hashemi and Bermejo above.  A generic change of
coordinates gives a new Borel-fixed ideal with the same regularity.  The papers
give a way to test whether a specific change of coordinates is general enough
to have the property, in which case we say the ideal has been moved to strong
Noether position.  See the Singular package called "m-regular" or something
like that.  We could write code to do this, too.  This could be a new new
function called "strongNoetherPosition" and a new option to "regularity" that
would call upon it.

Mike also says: it might be useful to have the version of noetherNormalization
that normalizes a chain of ideals.

Current status:  complete, with the following idea for future work:

    The current implementation seems to work. One might be able to increase
    efficiency if instead of using the lexicographical ordering, a block
    ordering is used instead.
