Title: Posets

Description:

An M2 package for working with posets. This would also link nicely with the
SimplicialComplexes.m2 package. For instance, from the point of view of an M2
user, a poset would be input/displayed by a list of pairs giving the covering
relations in the Hasse diagram, and the package would also have a number of
predefined posets (Boolean, Chains, etc) and be able to do some basic
operations on them (e.g. product, closure, etc). Also compute the Moebius
function, check if the poset is a lattice, compute the atomic complex, order
complex, etc
