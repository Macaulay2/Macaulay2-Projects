Title: Primary Decomposition via GTZ

Description:

    Add this algorithm to Macaulay2's primary decomposition as an optional strategy.

    [GTZ] Gianni, Patrizia; Trager, Barry; Zacharias, Gail, Gr√∂bner bases and
       primary decomposition of polynomial ideals. Computational aspects of
       commutative algebra.  J. Symbolic Comput. 6 (1988), no. 2-3, 149-167.

=============================================================================

Proposed by: Mike Stillman
Potential Advisor: Mike Stillman
Project assigned to: 
Current status: Mike has written some code in Macaulay2/packages/PrimaryDecomposition/GTZ.m2, but it's never
	called from top level.  The 0-dimensional case needs work, perhaps with some engine reworking.
	The code needs to be integrated.  It would be nice to get someone to work on this code!
