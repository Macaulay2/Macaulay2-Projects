Title: Quillen-Suslin

Description: 

    If M is a projective module over a polynomial ring k[x1,..,xn], the
    Quillen-Suslin Theorem asserts that M is free. However, given a
    presentation of M by generators and relations, it is not trivial to find a
    set of free generators. There is a Maple implementation:
    [http://wwwb.math.rwth-aachen.de/QuillenSuslin/], based on the first paper
    below (thanks to Bernd Sturmfels for the link). Algorithms for doing this
    are contained in the papers:

    * Here is some Maple code the implements an algorithm, wiht some
      added heuristics:

    Potential Application: If A is a 2-dimensional ring with Noether
    Normalization k[x,y], then the integral closure B of A is a free module
    over k[x,y]. Current algorithms to produce module generators of B may
    produce sets of generators that are too large. An example is given by Doug
    Leonard at his site[http://www.dms.auburn.edu/~leonada], under "example of
    the qth-power algorithm with two free variables and a larger than expected
    module generating set". This is a module of rank 9, given with 10
    generators. The desired algorithm would produce a 9-generator presentation
    (with no relations.)
