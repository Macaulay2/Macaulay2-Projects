Title: Resultants, discriminants, and Chow forms

Description:

An M2 package on resultants/discriminants/Chow forms.  As far as I'm aware there
is a rather old M2 code by Laurent Bus\'e (on his web page) computing
Bezoutians, Macaulay resultants, etc but one could probably try to salvage it
and mainly add lots of new things to it, and do things better now (use BGG,
A-discriminants, etc)

--Mike: Laurent Busé <lbuse@math.unice.fr> is still interested in this.
